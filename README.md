# Static Report

Static Report is a user interface for the output generated by [analyzer-lsp](https://github.com/konveyor/analyzer-lsp). As the name suggests, it's completely static in nature, and does not talk to any external APIs.

It is packaged within [kantra](https://github.com/konveyor/kantra) to generate visual reports.

## Developing / Contributing

### How it works?

As stated in the introduction, the interface is completely static in nature. All of the data displayed in the UI resides in `public/output.js` file. It is empty by default when you build the project. In order to display actual output of an analysis, `output.js` must contain data generated from that analysis. The [analyzer](https://github.com/konveyor/analyzer-lsp) generates output in the YAML format. Learn more about the analysis output format [here](https://github.com/konveyor/analyzer-lsp/blob/main/docs/violations.md).

The contents of the YAML output need to be converted into the specific format expected in `output.js`. We provide [analyzer-output-parser](./analyzer-output-parser/README.md) tool to do exactly that. It takes YAML output generated by the analyzer as input, along with some other options, and generates an `output.js` file. When you place this file in `public/output.js`, the UI will display the actual report.

### Running in development mode

> We have tested following steps with npm version 9.8.1 

This is useful for iterative development.

To run the project in development mode:

* Install dependencies:

  ```sh 
  npm clean-install
  ```

* Run the project:

  ```sh
  npm start
  ```
  This will open the UI in your browser. Replace `public/output.js` file with one generated for an actual analysis.

### Running in production mode

This is how the project gets packaged in [kantra](https://github.com/konveyor/kantra).

* Install dependencies:

  ```sh 
  npm clean-install
  ```

* Build the project:

  ```sh
  CI=true PUBLIC_URL=. npm run build
  ```
  This will generate a `build` directory. Among other files, it contains - `output.js` and `index.html`. Replace the `output.js` file with one generated for an actual analysis and open `index.html` in your browser.
